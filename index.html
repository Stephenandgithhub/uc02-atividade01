            what else to add in her bio, so i'm gonna add some lyrics to one of my
            fav songs Always on My Mind by Pet Shop Boys: Maybe I didn't treat you
            Quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I
            could Little things I should have said and done I never took the time
            You were always on my mind You were always on my mind.
